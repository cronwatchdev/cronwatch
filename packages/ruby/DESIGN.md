# The Ruby port

`packages/ruby` is the `cronwatch` gem: the same library as `@cronwatch/sdk`, for Ruby and Rails apps. It is a port, not a new design. The TypeScript SDK is the source of truth for every behaviour, message and stored byte; when the two disagree, the Ruby side is wrong.

## Rules

- Ruby 3.2 or newer; Rails 7.2, 8.0 and 8.1. The only runtime dependency is `fugit` (the cron parser Solid Queue and sidekiq-cron already bring). Everything else is optional and loaded only from its own entry point, like the SDK's, each raising a `LoadError` that names the gem to add when it is missing:
  - `require "cronwatch"`: the client, the memory store, the Slack, Discord, webhook, console and custom channels, and the provider channels (Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, Mailgun, SES, Twilio, Sentry, Honeybadger, Datadog, Rollbar, Bugsnag, New Relic) (standard library only)
  - `require "cronwatch/pg_cron"`: `Cronwatch::Sources::PgCron`, the pg_cron reader. No gem of its own: it queries through what it is given, an ActiveRecord class, pool or connection (`exec_query`), a `PG::Connection` (`exec_params`), or anything with `query(sql, params)`
  - `require "cronwatch/active_record"`: the ActiveRecord store (needs `activerecord`)
  - `require "cronwatch/rails"`: the Railtie, `Cronwatch::ActiveJob`, `Cronwatch::CheckJob`, `Cronwatch::Web`, the `cronwatch:check` task and the install generator (needs `railties` and `activejob`; Rails brings `rack`)
  - `require "cronwatch/sidekiq"`: `Cronwatch::Sidekiq`, its server middleware and `Cronwatch::Sidekiq::CheckWorker` (needs `sidekiq` 7 or newer)
  - `require "cronwatch/scheduler"`: schedules read from Solid Queue's `config/recurring.yml` and sidekiq-cron's schedule (`schedule: :from_scheduler`, `Cronwatch.declare_from_scheduler!`); loaded by the Rails and Sidekiq entry points
  - `require "cronwatch/web"`: the Rack dashboard and JSON API (needs `rack`)
  - `require "cronwatch/triage/anthropic"`: Claude triage (needs the `anthropic` gem)
- In a Rails app `require "cronwatch"` (Bundler's) also loads `cronwatch/rails`, which loads `cronwatch/web`, `cronwatch/scheduler`, and `cronwatch/sidekiq` when Sidekiq is loaded; the ActiveRecord store autoloads on first use. No file requires another that requires it back, and `ruby -w` prints nothing from `lib`.
- Times are Integer epoch milliseconds everywhere, as in the SDK, so `evaluate` ports line for line and stored rows are identical.
- Ruby API names are snake_case (`failures_before_alert`, `max_duration`, `started_at`). Conditions and alert types are symbols (`:missed`, `:over_budget`, `:recovered`). Anything that leaves the process (store rows, JSON columns, the JSON API, webhook payloads) uses the SDK's exact camelCase field names and string values, so a Node process and a Ruby process can share one database and `@cronwatch/mcp` works against either.
- Alert titles and messages are the SDK's text, character for character.
- Every condition opens once and closes with a recovery. No repeat alerts. A job whose schedule is removed while missed is open (declared again without one, or retired by the pg_cron source) has missed closed by the next check with a recovery of its own (`details: { after: [:missed], reason: :unscheduled, since: }`, the reason read back as a symbol by `Alert.from_h`, titled `<job> is no longer scheduled`), which takes missed out of `pending_recovery` so the next successful run's recovery does not name it again; other open conditions keep their own rules, and while silenced it closes without a message.
- Text entering a run (logged output, a returned string, an error's message, a metric's name) is made valid UTF-8 first: bytes that are not UTF-8 become U+FFFD, as a JavaScript string would hold them.
- A job's block may raise anything. A `StandardError` is recorded as the failure and raised again by `JobHandle#run`; anything outside it (`Interrupt`, `SystemExit`, `Sidekiq::Shutdown`, a `Timeout`, `NotImplementedError`) is recorded as a failed run (`Interrupted: Sidekiq::Shutdown`) and raised again by `Client#execute` itself, so no run is left `running` to be reported stuck later.
- The environment is read in one place, `Cronwatch::Environment`: `Rails.env` when Rails is loaded, else `RAILS_ENV`, then `RACK_ENV` (the SDK reads `NODE_ENV`).
- A client survives a fork (Puma, Unicorn, Sidekiq): it notes its pid, and in a child it starts with fresh locks, no check in flight and no interval thread, so `start` and `check` work there.
- No em or en dashes anywhere, as in the rest of the repo.

## The Ruby API

```ruby
CW = Cronwatch.new(
  store: Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord.new,          # default: Cronwatch::Stores::Memory.new
  alerts: [Cronwatch::Alerts::Slack.new(webhook_url: ENV.fetch("SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"))],
  retention: "30d",
)

NIGHTLY = CW.job("nightly-report",
  schedule: "0 2 * * *", timezone: "UTC", grace: "15m", timeout: "30m",
  expect: "Report written", budget: { cost: 2 }, failures_before_alert: 1)

NIGHTLY.run do |job|
  job.log("Report written:", path)
  job.metric(:cost, 1.2)
end

CW.check          # finds missed and stuck runs, prunes, returns a CheckResult
CW.start          # a background thread that checks every minute (plain Ruby processes)
CW.silence("nightly-report", for: "2h")
```

`run(name) { ... }` declares and runs; `run(id)` without a block reads a run, and refuses options. `silence` takes a duration or `for:`, nothing else. A second `start` while one runs does nothing, and one with a different interval is reported to `on_error` and ignored (call `stop` first). `execute` and `report` are public for the integrations and marked `@api private`.

In Rails:

```ruby
# config/initializers/cronwatch.rb
Cronwatch.configure do |c|
  c.store  = Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord.new
  c.alerts = [Cronwatch::Alerts::Slack.new(webhook_url: ENV["SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"])]
end

class NightlyReportJob < ApplicationJob
  include Cronwatch::ActiveJob
  cronwatch schedule: "0 2 * * *", grace: "15m", expect: "Report written"   # name: "nightly-report"

  def perform
    cronwatch.log("Report written")
    cronwatch.metric(:cost, 1.2)
  end
end

# config/recurring.yml (Solid Queue) or sidekiq-cron: run Cronwatch::CheckJob every 5 minutes, once, not per process.
# config/routes.rb: mount Cronwatch::Web.new(Cronwatch.client) => "/cronwatch"
```

The job name defaults to the class name without `Job`, dasherized (`NightlyReportJob` is `nightly-report`). A job raising still raises after the run is recorded, so ActiveJob retries and error reporters see it as before.

## Runs that span calls

`JobHandle#start(trigger: nil, id: nil)`, `JobHandle#resume(run_id)` and `Client#resume_run(name, run_id)` are the SDK's `job.start()`, `job.resume()` and `resumeRun()`, and return a `RunHandle` (the SDK's `RunHandle`): `id`, `job`, `started_at`, `active?`, `log`, `metric`, `metrics`, `flush`, `finish(outcome = nil)` and `fail(error)`. An outcome is nil or `{ status: "ok" }` (ok), `{ error: e }` (failed, its message from `Output.error_message`), or a String or `{ result: x }`, treated like `run`'s return value. The SDK's other outcome, a `Response` of 400 or more failing the run, has no counterpart, as `run` has none.

The client's side is `client.rb`'s, as `client.ts` has it: `start_run` checks the id (the SDK's messages, with `ArgumentError`, including the reserved `pgcron:` prefix, `Client::RESERVED_RUN_ID_PREFIX`) and holds a per-process `Mutex` keyed by the job and the id while it reads the store and inserts, so two starts with one id at once record one run, and another job's start with that id fails as it would one call later; `record_start` inserts the run as running and applies `on_run_start` through `update_state`; `finish_handle` reads the stored run again, joins the stored output with the handle's (capped) and merges metrics (the handle's win), then runs `conclude` and `record_finish`, the two halves of `execute`'s tail, so a finished handle and a finished block are judged by one piece of code. `flush_handle` redacts the lines it appends and writes only over a row still running and of this job (`update_run_if`); when it cannot, the handle keeps the lines for `finish`. The handle keeps the first 16 KB of what it flushed (`@head`), so `expect` at finish sees an early line as `run` would. The store never raises out of `start`, `resume`, `flush` or `finish`: failures go to `on_error` as `"recording <job>"`, `"starting <job>"`, `"resuming <job>"`, `"flushing <job>"` or `"finishing <job>"`, and a start that was not recorded is inserted at finish, as `execute` does, as is one this handle inserted that is gone at finish (written inside the app's transaction that then rolled back, on SQLite). A store that fails during finish records nothing and leaves the handle active (`RunHandle::Retry`), lines kept, so finish can be called again; an exception outside `StandardError` (`Interrupt`, a `Timeout`) raised while finish records is raised again after the same. A finish that records nothing (`run <id> of <job> was already finished by this handle; ignored`, `... was already finished as ok`, `... was not found`, `... belongs to job "<other>"`) is reported, never raised, and returns nil.

A run is judged once, however many processes finish it. `record_finish` claims the finish (`claim_finish`): it writes the run only over a stored row still `running`, else over one still `timeout` (a check already counted it as stuck: a late failure is written but not judged, a late success is judged and recovers), else reports why nothing was written. The write is the store's `update_run_if(run, from_statuses)`, one conditional `UPDATE`; a store without it gets a read then `update_run`, which is safe only while one process at a time finishes a run. Only the process whose write lands evaluates. The stuck check marks a run timed out the same way, only over a row still running, so a finish that landed meanwhile wins. `insert_run` raises for an id already stored, the memory store included, so a start or a `record_run` racing another process goes through the same claim.

## Delivery

`deliver: :now` (the default) sends each alert from the process that produced it. `deliver: :check` sends nothing: the alert is queued in the job's state (`undelivered`, at most `Client::MAX_UNDELIVERED`, the oldest dropped first) for the next check in a process that delivers now, which adds triage and sends it, as the SDK's `deliver: "check"` does. An alert no channel accepted is queued the same way and retried once per check, oldest first. A queued alert that no longer describes the job (`Evaluate.stale_alert?`) is dropped rather than sent; one check spends at most `Client::RETRY_BUDGET_MS` (20 seconds) retrying across all jobs; past `MAX_UNDELIVERED` the oldest are dropped and `on_error` hears of it. Triage is tried once per alert: `Alert#triage` nil with `triage_tried?` true is JSON `null`, never tried again.

Every read-modify-write of a job's state goes through `Client#update_state`: in turn with the process's other updates to the job, it reads the state, works out the next one, and writes it only when it changed, with `version` one higher, through the store's `compare_and_set_state` against the version read. A refused write is worked out again from a fresh read, up to `Client::STATE_ATTEMPTS` times. A store without `compare_and_set_state` gets `set_state`, as the SDK does. The version read is `Evaluate.state_version`: a whole number from 0 to 2**53 - 1, else 0, so a foreign row's `1.5` or `"x"` is written over rather than refusing every write of its job, and the SQL stores' statements read it the same way (the SDK's text, byte for byte). Every duration written goes through `Evaluate.run_duration`: 0 for a start after the finish, and never more than 2**53 - 1, however far off a foreign row's start is.

Each channel sends in a thread of its own with a 15 second timeout, and triage gets 25 seconds. A channel (or triage) that times out is left to finish; until it has, nothing more is sent to it (the alert counts as not delivered there, and is retried) and no second triage starts, so a hung channel holds one thread rather than one per alert.

## Channels

Every channel is an object with `name` and `call(alert, context)` that raises when the alert went nowhere; `context` is a `Client::ChannelContext`, whose `on_error(error)` reports a problem that did not stop the alert (one Twilio number refusing it) to the client's `on_error` as `"alert channel <name>"`. A channel whose `call` takes one argument (a custom channel written before the context, or a `Custom` block with one parameter) is called with the alert alone (`Client.takes_context?`). Each takes `http:` (anything with `post(url, body, headers)` returning `HTTP::Response`; `HTTP.default` is `Net::HTTP` with a 10 second deadline on the whole request, as `AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)` is: the body is read in chunks against it, and one cut off returns the status with an empty body, as the SDK reads a body it could not finish; header values are trimmed as `fetch` trims them), which is how the tests replay requests without a network. The provider channels are the SDK's, request for request: the same URL, headers (lowercase names, in the SDK's order) and body, written with `JS.json` so the bytes are identical; the same stable alert id (the first 32 hex characters of SHA-256 of job, type and time) for idempotency keys, event ids and UUIDs; the same error text, `"<Provider> <origin> answered <status>: <body>"`, the body's secrets of four or more characters replaced by `[redacted]` in a prefix of 200 plus the longest secret's length, and only then cut to 200 UTF-16 units on a code point (`Provider.error_body`), so no piece of a secret survives at the cut; credentials trimmed (`Provider.trimmed`, `require_credential`) before they go in a header, a webhook's header values too; lengths, cuts (the email subject's included) and SMS segments counted in UTF-16 units and GSM-7 septets as JavaScript counts them; the same recovered defaults (sent by Sentry, Rollbar, Datadog, New Relic and the email channels; not by Twilio, Honeybadger or Bugsnag unless `recovered: true`). No channel follows a redirect: `Net::HTTP` never does, so a 3xx is an answer outside 2xx and an error, where the SDK asks `fetch` for `redirect: "error"` (its message differs: a failed fetch rather than `answered 307`). Twilio sends to every number at once, a thread each, joined within the HTTP deadline; the alert is delivered when any number took it, each refusal reported through the context as `"<error> (to <mask>; <ok> of <n> numbers took the alert)"` (a mask of up to eight stars and the last four digits), and it raises `"<first error> (<n> of <n> numbers failed)"` only when all refused. `segments` is clamped to 1 to 10 (3 for anything not a number) and the body cut to 1600 characters; segments pack as `smsSegments` does, no extension character or surrogate pair straddling two. Constructor checks raise `ArgumentError` with the Ruby option names (`api_key`, not `apiKey`). The fixtures' `providerSends`, `providerFailures`, `twilioPartial` and `textCuts` replay all of it (the parallel Twilio requests compared in the numbers' order, as the SDK's `fetch` calls are made); SigV4 is also checked against the AWS test suite cases the SDK's tests use.

## Sources

`sources:` takes objects with `name` and `sync(host)`, as the SDK's `sources` does. `check` calls each, in order, after the store is ready and before anything else; one that raises is reported to `on_error` as `"source <name>"` and the check carries on, and the alerts a sync returns are added to the check's result. The host is the client: `job`, `record_run`, `store`, `now`, and `on_error(error, where)`.

`Client#record_run(run, evaluate: true)` is the SDK's `recordRun`: keyed by the run's id, a new run is inserted, a stored run still `running` (or `timeout`, marked by a check) is finished once this one is not running, through the same claim as a handle's finish (`record_over`, `claim_finish`), and anything else is left alone. A stored run of another job is left alone and reported (`run <id> of <job> belongs to job "<other>"; ignored`, as `"recording <job>"`), as is a finish another process's write beat (`... was already finished as failed; ignored`). Before that the output and error are made UTF-8, an `ok` run is checked against `expect`, and both are capped, redacted and cleared of NUL. A new run then goes through `on_run_start` and, once finished, `finish_run`; a stored run whose finish this process wrote goes straight to `finish_run`, unless it had been marked timeout and failed. An insert that fails because another process inserted the run first goes through the same claim; any other failure raises. `evaluate: false` writes without judging. The job must be declared in this process, or it raises `ArgumentError`.

`Sources::PgCron` is `sources/pgcron.ts` line for line: the same SQL (settings read from `pg_settings`, which has no row for one the role may not read, so the caller's transaction is never aborted; the runs query a `LEFT JOIN`, so open runs of any job are read), the same mapping from rows to runs (a finished row with no `start_time`, a run a restart cut off, starts at its `end_time`, else the job's newest run's start, else now; only the first five fields of a schedule are kept), the per-job cursor found from the store the first time (so a restart copies nothing twice), the first-sight import of the twenty newest runs judged only from the newest finished one (rows already stored under another name skipped), a not-yet-started run held for `HOLD_MS` (ten minutes) and then copied as running from when it was first seen, the cursor always moving past held rows, which are read again by runid, runs copied while going (or marked timeout since) read again until they finish, names no longer used for a job (renamed, unscheduled, no longer picked) declared again without a schedule with the reason in the description, and once per process the same for such names found scheduled in the store, `cron.log_run` off declaring jobs without schedules, and the one-time warnings for an unreadable `cron.timezone`, `log_run` off and an empty `cron.job` (row level security). Given an ActiveRecord class, it queries on the writing role, as the store does, even inside `connected_to(role: :reading)`. Parameters that are arrays go to Postgres as array literals; timestamps come back as `Time` (ActiveRecord decodes them) or text (the pg gem), both read to the millisecond.

## Keeping the two in step

`conformance/` at the repo root holds JSON cases generated from the TypeScript build by `scripts/conformance.mjs`: duration parsing and formatting, schedule parsing and due/deadline/covers (including daylight saving), sequences of run and check events with the alerts and state they must produce, alert titles and messages, stats and health. The SDK's tests fail when the files are stale, and the gem's tests replay every case. A behaviour change lands in TypeScript first, the fixtures are regenerated, and the gem is fixed until they pass.

A stored schedule this port cannot read (croner forms such as `W`, `LW`, a range with `#`, a seventh field, or a date no month has, written by a Node process sharing the store) is reported to `on_error` and that job is skipped by the check; the others are checked, and it is listed as failing (`Evaluate.unevaluable_summary`) without a next expected time.

An `expect` Regexp is matched with a timeout of one second (`Serialize::PATTERN_TIMEOUT`, or a shorter one the pattern or `Regexp.timeout` sets). Onigmo memoizes most patterns into linear time, so this is for the ones it cannot (a backreference or a lookaround, such as `/(\n*)\n*\n*\1x/`), which can backtrack for minutes over an output they do not match; the SDK's V8 has no such bound. A match that times out does not match, so the run fails with the ordinary `Output did not match /source/`, the rule every bounded port keeps (Rust's step budget, PHP's backtrack limit): a pattern is slow because it is searching an output it does not match, so this is the answer an engine that finished gives in nearly every case, and a guard that passed when it could not tell would hide the broken job it is there to catch. The pattern the app gave is not changed; each check matches a copy made with the timeout.

## Storage

The ActiveRecord store writes the same three tables as `packages/sdk/src/stores/sql.ts` (same names, `cronwatch_` prefix by default, same columns, same JSON in the JSON columns). The install generator creates them with a Rails migration (named for the prefix, so a second prefix gets its own); the store never creates tables itself in Rails. Postgres and SQLite are supported and tested; any other adapter is refused with `UnsupportedAdapter`.

On Postgres the store writes through a pool of its own: an abstract class under `Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord`, connected with the `connection_class`'s writing database config. Its writes never join a transaction the app has open, so a run recorded inside one survives a rollback (and its alert, once sent, is not sent again), and a check waiting on a job's row cannot deadlock with a job holding that row inside the app's transaction. SQLite allows one writer at a time, so there the store uses the app's pool and joins its transaction in a savepoint. Every call runs on the writing role, even inside `connected_to(role: :reading, prevent_writes: true)`.

## Web

`Cronwatch::Web` is a Rack app with the SDK routes' URLs, JSON shapes, auth and headers, and the SDK's `origin` option (normalised to scheme://host[:port], `ArgumentError` at construction for anything but an absolute http or https URL, "" as unset), read as `new URL(value).origin` reads it by `Web::Origin` (whitespace trimmed, host lowercased, IPv4 numbers written out, a non-ASCII host through `URI::IDNA`, the `simpleidn` gem or Addressable into punycode, or a clear `ArgumentError` without them; a port outside 1 to 65535 refused), which replaces the request's origin in the CSRF check, the sign-in cookie's Secure flag, the Referer the redirect back follows and the development sign-in line. Without it the request's origin is Rack's `base_url`, lowercased, which already follows `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` as Rails does, so the SDK's `trustProxy` (off by default there) has no counterpart. Rack takes the last of several forwarded values where `trustProxy` takes the first, so behind more than one proxy the docs say to set `origin:`. The rest: bearer or cookie token (`CRONWATCH_TOKEN`), `?token=` only on the HTML sign in, a token made per app and printed to stdout on the first request in development and test (`Cronwatch::Environment` instead of `NODE_ENV`), in a line that names the host only when `origin:` is set or the request's host is loopback (localhost, *.localhost, 127.0.0.0/8, ::1) and otherwise leaves it out, as the SDK's does, fail closed otherwise, the same CSRF and CSP rules, and `GET /api/check` with a bearer (the token or `CRON_SECRET`). The pages are `routes/html.ts` and `routes/timeline.ts` markup for markup (`Web::HTML`, `Web::Timeline`): the board's day timeline and a job's week are drawn from `Schedule.fires_between` (croner's `nextRuns` in batches, as `firesBetween` walks them) and read the same runs the SDK's routes read (twenty per job, two hundred for a lane whose twenty all fall inside the day, and `week_runs_limit` for a job's page), and every number is written as `toFixed` and `Math.round` write it, so `test/web/golden.json` matches byte for byte. The web app shell (`Web::PWA`: the manifest, `sw.js`, `app.js`, the offline page, and `Web::Icons`, which `scripts/make-dashboard-icons.mjs` writes beside the SDK's `routes/icons.ts`) is served before the token check, as the SDK serves it, with the base from `base_path:` or `SCRIPT_NAME`. Request bodies are read as the SDK's `request.json()` and `request.formData()` read them: forms through `Rack::Request#POST` (so a body `Rack::MethodOverride` already read still counts), JSON without a byte order mark and with bytes that are not UTF-8 as U+FFFD, every value as JavaScript's `String(value)`.
