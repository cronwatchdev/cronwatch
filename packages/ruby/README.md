# cronwatch

Cron and scheduled-job monitoring that lives inside your Ruby or Rails app. Wrap a job once; every run is recorded in a database you already have, and you are told when a run is missed, fails, gets stuck, runs slow, goes over budget or quietly does nothing. No server to run, no account to make.

This is the Ruby port of [`@cronwatch/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cronwatch/sdk): the same rules, the same alert text and the same stored rows, so a Ruby process can share one database with a Node, Python, PHP, Go or Rust process, and [`@cronwatch/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cronwatch/mcp) works against any of them.

## Install

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "cronwatch"
```

Ruby 3.2 or newer; the Rails integration is tested on Rails 7.2, 8.0 and 8.1. The only dependency is `fugit`, the cron parser Solid Queue and sidekiq-cron already bring. Everything else loads only from its own file:

| Require | For | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `cronwatch` | the client, the memory store, and the Slack, Discord, webhook, console, email (Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, Mailgun, SES), Twilio and error tracker (Sentry, Honeybadger, Datadog, Rollbar, Bugsnag, New Relic) channels | |
| `cronwatch/pg_cron` | `Cronwatch::Sources::PgCron`, which watches pg_cron jobs through an ActiveRecord or pg connection | |
| `cronwatch/active_record` | the ActiveRecord store | `activerecord` |
| `cronwatch/rails` | the Railtie, `Cronwatch::ActiveJob`, `Cronwatch::CheckJob`, `Cronwatch::Web`, the `cronwatch:check` task, the install generator | `railties`, `activejob` |
| `cronwatch/sidekiq` | `Cronwatch::Sidekiq` for `Sidekiq::Job` classes, its server middleware, `Cronwatch::Sidekiq::CheckWorker` | `sidekiq` 7 or newer |
| `cronwatch/scheduler` | schedules read from Solid Queue's or sidekiq-cron's config, `Cronwatch.declare_from_scheduler!` | |
| `cronwatch/web` | the dashboard and JSON API as a Rack app | `rack` |
| `cronwatch/triage/anthropic` | Claude triage | `anthropic` |

In a Rails app, `gem "cronwatch"` also loads `cronwatch/rails`, `cronwatch/web` and `cronwatch/scheduler` (Bundler requires it after Rails), `cronwatch/sidekiq` when Sidekiq is in the bundle, and the ActiveRecord store on first use. `cronwatch/triage/anthropic` is always required by hand, and so is `cronwatch/web` outside Rails.

## Plain Ruby

```ruby
require "cronwatch"

CW = Cronwatch.new(
  alerts: [Cronwatch::Alerts::Slack.new(webhook_url: ENV.fetch("SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"))],
)

NIGHTLY = CW.job("nightly-report",
  schedule: "0 2 * * *", timezone: "UTC", grace: "15m", timeout: "30m",
  expect: "Report written", budget: { cost: 2 }, floor: { pages: 1 })

NIGHTLY.run do |job|
  path = build_report
  job.log("Report written:", path)   # kept with the run, shown in alerts
  job.metric(:cost, 1.2)             # watched against budgets, floors and baselines
  job.metric(:pages, 12)             # fewer than 1 page is under the floor
end

CW.start_checking # checks for missed and stuck runs every minute, in a background thread
```

`run` returns what the block returns and raises what it raises, after the run is recorded. A script run from crontab exits when it is done, so instead of `start_checking`, add a second crontab line that declares the jobs and calls `CW.check` every five minutes.

A run that starts in one call and ends in another (a job that hands work to a queue, a webhook that reports back later) is one run too:

```ruby
run = NIGHTLY.start(id: batch_id)   # records a running run; a second start with this id finds it
# later, perhaps in another process
run = NIGHTLY.resume(batch_id)
run.log("Report written:", path)
run.finish                          # or run.fail(error); finish("text") and finish(result: x) work like run's return value
```

Neither raises for the store: failures go to `on_error`, and a finish of a run already finished, not found, or of another job records nothing and returns nil. A run is judged once, however many processes finish it at once, and a store that fails during `finish` leaves the handle active to finish again. A run never finished is marked stuck after the job's `timeout`.

Client options: `store`, `alerts`, `triage`, `cron_secret`, `retention` (default `"30d"`), `defaults`, `sources` (where runs the process does not wrap come from, such as pg_cron), `redact` (default: blank values that look like secrets; `false` keeps output as logged, or pass a callable), `deliver` (`:now` by default; `:check` queues alerts for another process's check to send, for a worker that cannot reach Slack), `on_error` and `now`. Methods: `job`, `run`, `resume_run`, `record_run`, `check`, `start_checking`/`stop`, `silence(name, for: "2h")`/`unsilence`, `forget`, `jobs`, `jobs_with_runs`, `job_summary`, `runs`, `get_run`, `defined_jobs`, `close`. [cronwatch.dev/docs/ruby](https://cronwatch.dev/docs/ruby/#api) has each one.

## Rails

```bash
bundle add cronwatch
bin/rails generate cronwatch:install    # a migration and config/initializers/cronwatch.rb
bin/rails db:migrate
```

The generator takes `--prefix` (table prefix, default `cronwatch_`) and `--database` (the database, from `config/database.yml`, whose migrations directory gets the migration; it also writes `app/models/cronwatch_record.rb`, an abstract class that `connects_to` that database, and names it as the store's `connection_class`, so the store reads the tables where the migration made them). The initializer it writes sets the ActiveRecord store, which Rails needs so web, worker and check processes see the same runs:

```ruby
# config/initializers/cronwatch.rb
Cronwatch.configure do |c|
  c.store  = Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord.new
  c.alerts = [Cronwatch::Alerts::Slack.new(webhook_url: ENV["SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"])]
end
```

`Cronwatch.configure` builds the app's client; `Cronwatch.client` returns it.

### ActiveJob

```ruby
class NightlyReportJob < ApplicationJob
  include Cronwatch::ActiveJob
  cronwatch schedule: "0 2 * * *", grace: "15m", expect: "Report written"   # name: "nightly-report"

  def perform
    cronwatch.log("Report written")
    cronwatch.metric(:cost, 1.2)
  end
end
```

Every `perform` is recorded as a run with the trigger `"active-job"` (runs recorded before 1.0 carry `"active_job"`). The name defaults to the class name without `Job`, dasherized, with `::` as `:` (`Reports::NightlyJob` is `reports:nightly`); pass `name:` to choose another. Jobs are declared once the app has booted, so a check knows a job that has never run. A job that raises still raises after the run is recorded, so ActiveJob retries and your error reporter see it as before.

### Sidekiq

```ruby
class HardWorker
  include Sidekiq::Job
  include Cronwatch::Sidekiq
  cronwatch schedule: "*/15 * * * *"   # name: "hard-worker"

  def perform
    cronwatch.log("Done")
  end
end
```

The same `cronwatch` as for ActiveJob, for classes that include `Sidekiq::Job` (or `Sidekiq::Worker`) directly. `Cronwatch::Sidekiq::ServerMiddleware` records each `perform` with the trigger `"sidekiq"` and raises the job's error on to Sidekiq, so retries and error handlers behave as before. In Rails the Railtie adds it to the Sidekiq server; elsewhere add it in `Sidekiq.configure_server` and call `Cronwatch::Sidekiq.ready!` once `Cronwatch.configure` has run. An ActiveJob class on Sidekiq's adapter keeps `Cronwatch::ActiveJob`; the middleware passes ActiveJob's wrapper through, so it is recorded once.

### Schedules from the scheduler's config

```ruby
cronwatch schedule: :from_scheduler, grace: "15m"   # ActiveJob or Sidekiq
```

reads the class's one entry in Solid Queue's `config/recurring.yml` (the section for `Rails.env`) or sidekiq-cron's `config/schedule.yml`, so the schedule is written once. Fugit phrases such as `every day at 3am` or `every hour at minute 12` become the cron expression Fugit makes of them (`0 3 * * *`, `12 * * * *`), in the zone the scheduler reads them in. Each conversion is checked against Fugit's own next run times; anything CronWatch would not expect at exactly those times is refused at boot rather than approximated: every other week (`%`), days counted back from the month's end other than the last, random times (`~`), offsets instead of IANA zones, and a time that daylight saving skips (Fugit skips that run; CronWatch would report it missed). A class with no entry, or with two, also stops the boot; one scheduled only in another environment's section (Rails 8's `recurring.yml` has only `production:`) is declared without a schedule, and a process started with `SOLID_QUEUE_SKIP_RECURRING` still reads the entry.

`Cronwatch.declare_from_scheduler!(grace: "10m")` in the initializer watches every enabled entry once the app has booted: classes that call `cronwatch` declare themselves, other classes are named as `cronwatch` would name them and their runs are recorded, and Solid Queue `command:` tasks are named after their key. `except:` leaves keys out. `Cronwatch::Scheduler.sources` sets where to read, when the defaults (Solid Queue's file when Solid Queue is loaded, sidekiq-cron's when sidekiq-cron is) are not right.

### Scheduling the check

Failures are caught as they happen, but a run that never started or never finished can only be noticed by looking. `Cronwatch::CheckJob` looks: it loads `app/jobs` (and `app/workers` and `app/sidekiq`) when the app does not eager load, declares every monitored job and runs the check. Run it every five minutes.

Solid Queue:

```yaml
# config/recurring.yml
production:
  nightly_report:
    class: NightlyReportJob
    schedule: every day at 2am
  cronwatch_check:
    class: Cronwatch::CheckJob
    schedule: every 5 minutes
```

sidekiq-cron:

```yaml
# config/schedule.yml
nightly_report:
  cron: "0 2 * * * UTC"
  class: "NightlyReportJob"
cronwatch_check:
  cron: "*/5 * * * *"
  class: "Cronwatch::CheckJob"   # Cronwatch::Sidekiq::CheckWorker when ActiveJob does not use Sidekiq
```

Or from a crontab: `bin/rails cronwatch:check`.

### Mounting the dashboard

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Cronwatch.client.routes => "/cronwatch"
end
```

Set `CRONWATCH_TOKEN` to a long random string and open `/cronwatch?token=<it>` once; the browser keeps a cookie. Without a token, while the environment (the first of `CRONWATCH_ENV`, `APP_ENV`, then `Rails.env` (when Rails is loaded), `RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV` that holds more than spaces, trimmed and lowercased) is `development`, `dev`, `local`, `test` or `testing`, it makes a token of its own and prints a sign-in link to standard output on its first request (open it once; unless `origin:` is set or the request's host is loopback, the link leaves the host out, since a client chooses it); anywhere else it answers 503. Puma, Unicorn, Thin and rackup set `RACK_ENV` to `development` when nothing names an environment, production included, so under one of them `RACK_ENV=development` alone does not count: `CRONWATCH_ENV`, `APP_ENV`, `Rails.env` or `RAILS_ENV` must say development (or `RACK_ENV` say `test`, `dev` or `local`). To rely on the app's own sign in, mount it behind that (Devise's `authenticate` block, or a routing constraint) and pass `token: nil`. The URLs, JSON shapes, headers and CSRF rules are the SDK's, so the MCP server reads it unchanged. The request's origin, which the CSRF check compares against, is what Rack reports and so already follows `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`; pass `origin: "https://app.example.com"` to pin it instead. `GET /cronwatch/api/check` with a bearer (the token or `CRON_SECRET`) runs the check, for an outside cron.

There is no `handler()` as in the TypeScript SDK: for a job triggered over HTTP, wrap the controller action's body in `CW.job(...).run` (declared once, at boot) and check the bearer in the controller.

In any other Rack app:

```ruby
# config.ru
map("/cronwatch") { run CW.routes }
```

`client.routes(**options)` (`token:`, `base_path:`, `origin:`) is the one way to build the dashboard, as `routes()` is in every language.

### Public and internal

Public means what this README and the docs at cronwatch.dev name. Everything else is internal and may change in any release: anything marked `@api private` in the source (`Evaluate`, `Schedule`, `Format`, `JS`, `HTTP` and the dashboard's helpers among them), and the constants made private with `private_constant`.

### Deprecated

These still work through every 1.x release and go in 2.0, each with a warning in Ruby's deprecation category (shown under `ruby -w` or `-W:deprecated`): `Cronwatch::Web.new(client, **options)` (use `client.routes(**options)`), `client.start(every)` (use `client.start_checking(every)`), `client.run(id)` without a block (use `client.get_run(id)`) and `client.silence(name, "2h")` (use `client.silence(name, for: "2h")`). The ActiveJob trigger is `active-job` from 1.0; runs recorded before keep `active_job`.

## Stores

- `Cronwatch::Stores::Memory.new`: the default. Nothing survives a restart.
- `Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord.new(prefix: "cronwatch_", connection_class: nil)`: Postgres or SQLite through ActiveRecord, in `cronwatch_jobs`, `cronwatch_runs` and `cronwatch_state`. `connection_class` picks the pool (a class, or its name). In Rails the generator's migration creates the tables; elsewhere call `Cronwatch::Stores::ActiveRecord.create_tables!` (and `drop_tables!`). The store never creates them itself, and raises `MissingTables` when they are not there. On Postgres it writes through a connection pool of its own (up to the database config's `pool` more connections per process), so a run is recorded outside any transaction the app has open and stays recorded when that transaction rolls back; on SQLite it uses the app's pool, and inside an open transaction each call runs in a savepoint. It always writes on the writing role, even inside `connected_to(role: :reading)`. Other adapters, MySQL among them, are refused with `UnsupportedAdapter`.

Finished runs older than `retention` (default `"30d"`) are pruned by the check; each job's newest run is kept.

## Alerts

```ruby
Cronwatch::Alerts::Slack.new(webhook_url: ENV.fetch("SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"))
Cronwatch::Alerts::Discord.new(webhook_url: ENV.fetch("DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"))
Cronwatch::Alerts::Webhook.new(url: "https://hooks.example.com/cronwatch", secret: ENV["CRONWATCH_WEBHOOK_SECRET"])
Cronwatch::Alerts::Console.new   # the default
Cronwatch::Alerts::Resend.new(api_key: ENV.fetch("RESEND_API_KEY"), from: "alerts@example.com", to: "ops@example.com")
Cronwatch::Alerts::Sentry.new(dsn: ENV.fetch("SENTRY_DSN"))
# and Postmark, Sendgrid, Mailgun, Ses, Twilio, Honeybadger, Datadog, Rollbar, Bugsnag, NewRelic

Cronwatch::Alerts::Custom.new("pagerduty") do |alert|
  next if alert.type == :recovered
  PagerDuty.trigger(summary: alert.title, details: alert.message)
end
```

Every alert goes to every channel. A channel that raises, or takes longer than 15 seconds, goes to `on_error` and never blocks the others. Each condition alerts once when it opens and once more when a clean run closes it; there are no repeat alerts. The webhook's body is the alert's JSON with `"schema": 1` first (its [JSON Schema](https://cronwatch.dev/schemas/webhook/1.json)); parse the fields, not `title` and `message`, whose wording may change. It signs the body with `X-CronWatch-Signature: sha256=<hex>`, the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body, which a receiver checks with `Rack::Utils.secure_compare("sha256=#{Cronwatch::Alerts::Webhook.signature(secret, raw_body)}", header)`.

## Triage

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "anthropic"
```

```ruby
require "cronwatch/triage/anthropic"

Cronwatch.configure do |c|
  c.triage = Cronwatch::Triage::Anthropic.new(context: "A Rails app on Postgres, jobs on Solid Queue.")
end
```

Adds two to four sentences from Claude (likely cause, first thing to check) to every alert except recoveries. Needs the `anthropic` gem and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. It runs only when an alert is sent, never per run, and the alert goes out without it after 25 seconds. Options: `model` (default `"claude-opus-5"`), `effort` (`"medium"`), `max_tokens` (`800`), `context`, `fallbacks` (`true`), `api_key`, `client`.

## Sharing a database with a Node app

The ActiveRecord store writes the same three tables as `@cronwatch/sdk/postgres` and `@cronwatch/sdk/sqlite`: same names, columns and indexes, epoch milliseconds in the time columns, the SDK's camelCase JSON in the JSON columns. [`test/active_record/node_compat_test.rb`](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/blob/main/packages/ruby/test/active_record/node_compat_test.rb) runs the SDK's stores in Node beside this one, on SQLite and Postgres, and checks that each reads what the other wrote, that the tables are the same whoever creates them, and that the rows are the same bytes. Use the same prefix on both sides and give each job a name only one side uses. Then one dashboard, Rails or Node, shows every job, and one MCP server reads them all. The Python, PHP, Go and Rust ports keep the same tables too, so a process in any of them can share the database the same way.

## Kept in step with the TypeScript SDK

The TypeScript SDK is the source of truth. `npm run conformance` at the repository root runs it and writes JSON cases to `conformance/`: duration parsing and formatting, schedules including daylight saving, sequences of runs and checks with the alerts and state they must produce, alert titles and messages, stats and health. This gem's tests replay every case, and the SDK's own check fails when the files are stale. A change of behaviour lands in TypeScript first, the cases are regenerated, and the gem is fixed until its tests pass. When the two disagree, the Ruby side is wrong.

The dashboard is held to the SDK the same way: [`test/web/golden.json`](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/blob/main/packages/ruby/test/web/golden.json) records what the SDK's routes answer to a fixed set of requests, and [`test/web_golden_test.rb`](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/blob/main/packages/ruby/test/web_golden_test.rb) makes `Cronwatch::Web` answer them byte for byte.

The design of the port is in [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/blob/main/packages/ruby/DESIGN.md).

## Testing

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

`rake test` runs four suites, each in its own process: `rake test:core` (the client, channels, conformance, the Rack app, Sidekiq without Rails, schedule conversion checked against Fugit), `rake test:slow` (every schedule conversion walked against Fugit across a year, some ten seconds), `rake test:active_record` (the store, on SQLite, and on Postgres when `CRONWATCH_TEST_PG` is set) and `rake test:rails` (a small Rails app: ActiveJob, Sidekiq, schedules from `recurring.yml` and `schedule.yml`, `CheckJob`, the rake task, the generator).

```sh
CRONWATCH_TEST_PG=postgres://postgres:pw@127.0.0.1:5432/cw bundle exec rake test
```

The node compatibility tests run the built SDK and its drivers, and skip themselves otherwise, so build it first at the repository root:

```sh
npm ci && npm run build
```

The default Gemfile tests Rails 8.1. Each supported Rails series has its own Gemfile, with its own lockfile, in [`test/rails/gemfiles`](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/tree/main/packages/ruby/test/rails/gemfiles):

```sh
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=test/rails/gemfiles/rails_7_2.gemfile bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=test/rails/gemfiles/rails_7_2.gemfile bundle exec rake test
```

`rails_8_0.gemfile` and `rails_8_1.gemfile` work the same way. Sidekiq and sidekiq-cron are test gems too: Rails 8.0 and 8.1 resolve Sidekiq 8, and `rails_7_2.gemfile` pins Sidekiq 7 (`CRONWATCH_SIDEKIQ=7`), so both majors are tested. CI runs Ruby 3.2 with Rails 7.2, Ruby 3.4 with Rails 8.0 and 8.1, and Ruby 4.0 with Rails 8.1, all against Postgres.

When the SDK's routes or pages change, regenerate the dashboard fixture from the repository root:

```sh
npm run build --workspace packages/sdk && TZ=UTC node packages/ruby/test/web/golden.mjs
```

`npm run check` fails while `test/web/golden.json` or `conformance/` is stale.

The MCP server's tests can also drive this gem's `Cronwatch::Web` over HTTP ([`test/web/server.rb`](https://github.com/phillips-jon/cronwatch/blob/main/packages/ruby/test/web/server.rb)). They need `fugit`, `rack` and a server rackup can start (puma, or webrick, which the Gemfile's test group has) in the Ruby they run, and only run when asked, from `packages/mcp`:

```sh
CRONWATCH_TEST_RUBY=1 CRONWATCH_RUBY="rbenv exec ruby" npm test
```

`CRONWATCH_RUBY` is the command that runs Ruby; it defaults to `ruby`.
