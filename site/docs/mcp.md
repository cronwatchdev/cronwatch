# MCP server

`@cronwatch/mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server over stdio. It talks to the JSON API your app mounts: `cw.routes()` in a TypeScript app, or `Cronwatch::Web` in a Ruby or Rails one, which serves the same API at the same paths. It needs a URL and the token, and nothing else. It runs on Node through `npx` either way; a Rails app does not need Node for anything else.

## Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add cronwatch \
  -e CRONWATCH_URL=https://app.example.com/cronwatch \
  -e CRONWATCH_TOKEN=your-token \
  -- npx -y @cronwatch/mcp
```

## Other clients

Any client that launches stdio servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cronwatch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cronwatch/mcp"],
      "env": { "CRONWATCH_URL": "https://app.example.com/cronwatch", "CRONWATCH_TOKEN": "your-token" }
    }
  }
}
```

`--url` and `--token` work as flags too. The URL is the mount point (`/cronwatch` in the examples, wherever `cw.routes()` or `mount Cronwatch::Web` put it). For a local app without `CRONWATCH_TOKEN`, a development server makes a token of its own and prints a sign-in link to its log on the first request; pass the `?token=` from that link as `CRONWATCH_TOKEN` here, or set one yourself.

## Tools

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `list_jobs` | every job with health, schedule, last run and next due. The place to start. |
| `get_job` | one job in detail: definition, open conditions, and recent runs with errors, output tails and metrics |
| `run_check` | look for missed and stuck runs now and send due alerts |
| `silence_job` | stop alerts for a duration, for example during a fix |
| `unsilence_job` | resume them |
| `forget_job` | remove a job that no longer exists in the code |
| `get_setup_guide` | the TypeScript code to add CronWatch to a job, so the agent writes it correctly (for Rails, point it at [Ruby on Rails](/docs/rails/)) |

The tools return prose an agent can act on, not raw JSON. A typical exchange: "why did invoice-run fail last night" becomes `get_job`, a read of the error and the earlier runs, and a suggested fix in your code.

## Security

The token gives the agent everything the dashboard can do. Give it a dedicated app deployment or accept that an agent can silence and forget jobs. Run history includes whatever your jobs logged; if that is sensitive, log less.

## The agent skill

A Claude Code skill in the repository teaches the workflow: where to declare jobs, how to wrap them, how to investigate a failure with these tools. See [Agent skill](/docs/agent-skill/).
